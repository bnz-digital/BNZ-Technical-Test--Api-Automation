**BNZ Technical Test - Api automation**

Hello ðŸ‘‹

Thank you so much for taking the time to interview with us here at BNZ. Before the in-person/remote interview, we'd appreciate if you could begin a small exercise, which will facilitate some discussion during the interview.

This isn't a exam, there are no right or wrong solutions. We are more interested in your approach and reasoning behind the decisions you have (or would) implement.

1.	Navigate to  https://open-meteo.com/en/docs  and find city wellington and get the Api end point for weather data in wellington.
2.	Using any opensource tool of your choice please automate  the test case.
3.	Add validations to the response appropriately.
4.	Using similar approach ,automate a testcase to find weather data for Auckland.
5.For auckland Add daily wehather variables,weathercode and sunrise **without** passing the  mandatory timezone  parameter, capture and validate the response.
